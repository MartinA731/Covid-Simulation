# Covid-Simulation

The name of my project is Coronavirus Analysis Simulator.
The user will also be able to look at visualizations that describe coronavirus in unique ways. They can make a simulation of a grocery
store with people who have the virus inside, and a simulation that demonstrates the risk of getting the virus with several inputs and movements.

In order to run this project, the user must run the file called tp3.py in an editor. This code will require these other python files to run:
cmu_112_graphics.py, visual.py, groceryStore.py, states.py for use.

The user must install Pandas for use of my program.
